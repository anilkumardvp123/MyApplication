Vujicic was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 to Dušanka and Borislav Vujičić, Serbian immigrants from Yugoslavia.[5][6]

He was born without fully formed limbs. According to his autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him when the nurse held him in front of her, and she and her husband went out of the hospital.[7]

Originally, the toes of one of his feet were fused. An operation was performed to separate the toes so that he can use them as fingers to grab. He refers to it as his chicken drumstick.[8]
